Added a low-poly bottle and plate to the scene.
Rendered the scene using Blender's Cycles for more realistic lighting and shadows.

Key Learnings:

Modeling Details: Created a simple bottle and plate to add realism and context to the environment.
Cycles Rendering: Experimented with Blender's Cycles renderer to achieve softer, more natural lighting and shadows compared to Eevee.
Lighting Techniques: Used a combination of area and sun lights to create a warm, moody atmosphere with well-defined shadows.
Material Refinement: Applied basic materials to highlight the differences between objects, focusing on color and reflectivity.
